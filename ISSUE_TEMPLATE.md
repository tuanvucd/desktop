[JIRA tickets](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/browse/MM-14183?jql=labels%20%3D%20desktop) are created for all valid bug reports filed here. Bugs and features that the GChat core team are not immediately working on are opened as [Help Wanted GitHub issues](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/contribution-checklist/) and welcome to contributions. 

Our goal is to bring the GChat desktop repository into our day-to-day internal process with the hope of having more frequent desktop releases with faster feature development and turnaround time on bug fixes.
